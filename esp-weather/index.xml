In a previous post I've described how to build a Weather Station based on ESP8266 chip and various breakout boards you can buy e.g. on Aliexpress. In this post, however I'll share with you how I built a standalone PCB boards containing all the required components. To recap - this is a ESP8266 based Weather Station, that measures surrounding air temperature, humidity, pressure along with light and battery voltage. Connects to an MQTT broker and reports it's data there.</description></item><item><title>Building ESP8266 Weather station with BME280 (part 1)</title><link>https://itohi.com/esp-weather/building-esp8266-weather-station-part-i/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jul 2018 01:01:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://itohi.com/esp-weather/building-esp8266-weather-station-part-i/</guid><description>
Ever since I started playing around with ESP modules I wanted to measure weather conditions in multiple location at home, friends, etc. The best way to achieve that would be to build a station that gathers various environment parameters and publishes them somewhere. That is what I've done. The very first prototype was done using ESP-1 module, DHT-11 humidity sensor and BMP280 breakout board. The station publishes gathered data to a MQTT broker from where it can be further gathered and analysed.</description></item></channel></rss>
