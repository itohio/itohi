I was always fascinated with balancing robots and wanted to build one myself. Some time ago I started collecting IMU, arduino boards, wheels, motors for other wheeled robots and one day decided to build a balancing robot instead. I've used wheels from old four wheel drive robot that used mouse sensors for odometry and was driven by an Arduino Pro mini. That robot never went alive anyway :)
Originally the robot was built using Arduino pro mini and all it could do was balance.</description></item><item><title>ESP8266 Wheelie</title><link>https://itohio.github.io/blog/esp8266-wheelie/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2018 01:01:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://itohio.github.io/blog/esp8266-wheelie/</guid><description>
As I've mentioned in the last blog post, I was trying to build a four wheel drive robot using arduino that utilizes two A3080 mouse sensors for odometry. Sadly that project never got finished and I disassembled the robot and built a balancing robot instead. However later I decided to not abandon the four wheel drive robot and ordered several ADNS3080 sensors with proper optics, obtained an electric wheelie toy, which lead to the birth of this WiFi controlled toy car.</description></item></channel></rss>
