I've been involved in Full Stack for a while now in one form or another(either maintaining, designing or working on Full Stack projects). Even during school time, I was building websites for myself and my friends. I've built sites commercially even. Although I've been using either pure HTML+JS or even PHP/Perl at some point. I rarely liked this activity, especially since the visual designs of the web pages were lacking and I just couldn't make myself study some visual design :(</description></item></channel></rss>
