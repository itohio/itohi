VS Code is an light but powerful editor developed by Microsoft. I have been using this editor for Python and embedded development(using PlatformIO) for a few months now.
Using PlatformIO with VSCode is rather simple - just install it through built in package manager and you're good to go. However python development needs a bit more work to setup properly. Especially if you want to develop Django apps with VSCode. That is what I'll be covering here in this post.</description></item></channel></rss>
