I've been involved in Full Stack for a while now in one form or another(either maintaining, designing or working on Full Stack projects). Even during school time, I was building websites for myself and my friends. I've built sites commercially even. Although I've been using either pure HTML+JS or even PHP/Perl at some point. I rarely liked this activity, especially since the visual designs of the web pages were lacking and I just couldn't make myself study some visual design :(</description></item><item><title>How Its Been in 2020-2022</title><link>https://itohi.com/blog/how-its-been-in-2020-2022/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2022 12:46:27 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://itohi.com/blog/how-its-been-in-2020-2022/</guid><description>
Years 2020, 2021 and 2022 have been tough for almost everyone. The pandemic, the war, global economic collapse, bancruptcies in Crypto sphere... You name it. Although, for me it was a rather productive period(despite a divorce spanning almost 3 years), since I have accustomed to working from home and working on various project remotely. The range of projects varied from working on a system that tailors advertisements to people behavior to optimizing Internet traffic by cleverly and autonomously arranging relay nodes all around the globe.</description></item></channel></rss>
