I was building a Christmas set of spherical speakers just to familiarize myself with ADAU1401 Sigma DSP. And I wanted to add Bluetooth capability to the speakers so that they could receive sound data from an old Samsung Galaxy Node 10.1 in the kitchen.
Granted, I have ordered some Bluetooth audio receivers, however, while they are being shipped, I thought to myself: Hey, I already have powerful CPUs(ESP32) with Bluetooth. These chips have I2S and I have I2S DACs waiting for another project!</description></item></channel></rss>
