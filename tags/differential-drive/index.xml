As I've mentioned in the last blog post, I was trying to build a four wheel drive robot using arduino that utilizes two A3080 mouse sensors for odometry. Sadly that project never got finished and I disassembled the robot and built a balancing robot instead. However later I decided to not abandon the four wheel drive robot and ordered several ADNS3080 sensors with proper optics, obtained an electric wheelie toy, which lead to the birth of this WiFi controlled toy car.</description></item></channel></rss>
